My name is Cloe Lee. Here is little bit more about me:

I took my first coding class when I was 21, and it blowed my mind! It was too late to change my major but instead, I learned more embedded software system as an electrical engineering degree. Luckily, I now work as a software engineer at Honeywell Aerospace in my first career.

As I am getting closer to high level programming than I ever thought, I found more interested in web development. In my spare time, I am developing Home Automation and Web Application.

I have never grown up, but I will never stop growing.
-Author C. Clarke-

My life motto is never to stop growing up. My life is too short to learn countless things I donâ€™t know/will never know.

I am admired by knowledge sharing culture in the software engineering world, and I decided to contribute something to return all the helps I owe the community. This is why I started my blog to share some tips from my tech work!

If you are more curious about me, here is more. [too much information warning]

I grew up in South Korea and lived for 75% of my life span. After I immigrated to the US with my mom and my sister in summer 2013, it changed my entire life. I had not heard or seen any women as an engineer in my hometown. Engineering was not the path I considered until I became to ace all my math classes and physics classes. I am pretty proud of myself ending of becoming an women software engineer!
